# simuvator

Elevator simulator built in Go as a learning exercise for the language

The idea is to eventually have a bank of elevators that act pretty much as you'd expect elevators to act.
I'd like to set it up simulation style so that I can set parameters and see it run. See what capacity it can handle, etc.

Eventually I want some realtime visualization. Also, should be able to speed up time in the simulation.
